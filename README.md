## Inspiration ✨

Do you want to meet the **love of your life** with a similar music taste? Have you ever been tired of constantly scrolling through profiles on apps like Tinder or Bumble and want a simple match? Well we have just the solution for you: Introducing **MusicMatch**!

## What it does 💜

For our prototype, we were able to store users' Spotify tokens to access information about their music tastes.

### Prototype (Dreams) 💭

The user will first login by connecting their Spotify account. Next, they will choose their profile information such as gender identity, sexual orientation, pictures, biography, and age. Then the user needs but sit back and let the matches come in through our custom algorithm! On the first of each month, each user will get a minimum of 10 matches and then have the ability to message their matches.
